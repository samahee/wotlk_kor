# Questie-Epoch (3.3.5a)

Hybrid Questie build for **Project Epoch** on the 3.3.5a (WotLK 12340) client. It combines:

- [Aldori15/Questie (335 branch)](https://github.com/Aldori15/Questie) &mdash; the WotLK 3.3.5a port of the Classic Questie addon.
- [Bennylavaa/pfQuest-epoch](https://github.com/Bennylavaa/pfQuest-epoch) &mdash; the pfQuest database of Project Epoch custom content (new NPCs, objects, items and quests).

The pfQuest-epoch data is translated into Questie's native schema at load time and merged into the base Wrath database, so Project Epoch's custom quests show up on the world map, minimap, tracker and tooltips the same way Blizzard quests do.

> [!WARNING]
> **Highly experimental.** The pfQuest-epoch dataset is incomplete and evolves quickly, and the runtime translation layer has not seen extensive testing. Expect missing coords, wrong pre-quest chains, misplaced icons, occasional lua errors and other rough edges. **Use at your own risk.** If you find bugs please open an issue &mdash; but please do not bother the upstream Questie or pfQuest-epoch maintainers with problems that only exist in this fork.

## Credits

This 3.3.5a / Project Epoch mix was put together by **Neticsoul**, but all the heavy lifting belongs to the upstream projects. This repository only glues them together.

## Installation

1. Download this repository as a zip.
2. Extract it into `Interface/AddOns/`. The folder must be named **`Questie-335-Epoch`** (the zip from GitHub will unpack as `questie-335-epoch-main` or similar &mdash; rename it).
3. Remove any previous `Questie` or `Questie-335` folder from `Interface/AddOns/` to avoid conflicts.
4. Launch the 3.3.5a client. On first login Questie will print *"Questie DB has updated!"* and recompile. After a few seconds you should see a line like
   `[Questie-Epoch] added N quests, N NPCs, N objects, N items.`
5. Enjoy.

### If you had Questie installed before

After replacing the folder, force a recompile once:

```
/run Questie.db.global.dbIsCompiled=false; ReloadUI()
```

or, if icons still look wrong, reset the saved variables of Questie in your WTF folder.

## How the Epoch integration works

- `epoch/data/` &mdash; raw pfQuest-epoch data tables (units, objects, items, quests).
- `epoch/enUS/` &mdash; enUS names / titles / descriptions from pfQuest-epoch.
- `Database/Epoch/EpochPreamble.lua` &mdash; bootstraps the `pfDB` global that the raw files populate.
- `Database/Epoch/EpochDB.lua` &mdash; translates pfDB into Questie's native schema (`startedBy`, `finishedBy`, `objectives`, `spawns`, `requiredRaces`, &hellip;) **without overwriting** any existing WotLK entry, then frees the temporary pfDB global.

The merge happens inside Questie's normal init flow, right between `LoadBaseDB` and `QuestieCorrections:Initialize`, so all Questie features (tracker, tooltips, waypoints, journey log, search) work on Epoch quests too.

Questie's schema version was bumped so existing installs recompile once on first launch.

---

## Known limitations

- Only entries **absent** from the base WotLK DB are added. Epoch overrides of existing vanilla/TBC/WotLK quests are currently ignored.
- Quest descriptions are taken from pfQuest-epoch when available; when absent, Questie falls back to its auto-generated objective text.
- `requiredSkill`, reputations and many flags are only partially mapped &mdash; some quests may appear as available when they actually aren't.
- No localization beyond **enUS** for Epoch content (base Questie translations are unaffected).

---

## Reporting bugs

When opening an issue please include:

1. The exact **QuestID** (hover a map icon with Shift).
2. A screenshot of the map / tooltip.
3. The Lua error text (enable with `/console scriptErrors 1`).
4. Whether the bug reproduces on upstream [Aldori15/Questie](https://github.com/Aldori15/Questie) *without* the Epoch patch &mdash; if yes, report it upstream instead.
